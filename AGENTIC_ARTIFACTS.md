# Agentic Artifacts System

## Overview

The Agentic Artifacts System enhances the existing artifact generation and editing capabilities with advanced AI agents that provide multi-step generation, quality evaluation, and iterative improvement. This system transforms single-step artifact creation into a sophisticated, autonomous process that delivers superior quality results.

## Key Features

### ðŸ¤– Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Orchestrator Agents**: Plan and coordinate artifact creation/updates
- **Worker Agents**: Specialized for each artifact type (PixiJS, Code, Design, Content)
- **Evaluator Agents**: Quality assessment and improvement recommendations

### ðŸ”„ Iterative Improvement
- Multi-step generation with quality evaluation loops
- Automatic refinement based on quality thresholds
- Context-aware improvements across iterations

### ðŸ“Š Quality Assessment
- Domain-specific quality metrics for each artifact type
- Real-time quality scoring and feedback
- Automated issue detection and suggestions

### âš¡ Enhanced Tools
- `createAgenticDocument`: Advanced artifact creation with multi-step AI
- `evaluateArtifact`: Comprehensive quality assessment
- `optimizeArtifact`: Performance and quality optimization

### Agent Types

#### PixiJS Agents
- **Worker**: PixiJS v8 expert with performance optimization
- **Evaluator**: Performance, interactivity, and visual quality assessment
- **Quality Metrics**: Performance, interactivity, visual appeal, responsiveness, error handling

#### Code Agents
- **Worker**: Software development with security and performance focus
- **Evaluator**: Syntax, performance, security, maintainability assessment
- **Quality Metrics**: Syntax correctness, performance, security, maintainability, testability

#### Design Agents
- **Worker**: UX/UI design with accessibility focus
- **Evaluator**: Accessibility, usability, consistency assessment
- **Quality Metrics**: WCAG compliance, usability, consistency, responsiveness, aesthetics

#### Content Agents
- **Worker**: Content writing with clarity and engagement focus
- **Evaluator**: Grammar, structure, engagement assessment
- **Quality Metrics**: Clarity, grammar, structure, engagement, accuracy

## Usage

### Creating Agentic Artifacts

```typescript
// In chat, users can request:
"Create an enhanced PixiJS artifact using agentic AI with multi-step generation"

// This triggers the createAgenticDocument tool with:
{
  title: "Interactive PixiJS Experience",
  kind: "pixi",
  requirements: "High performance, interactive elements",
  qualityThreshold: 8.0
}
```

### Quality Evaluation

```typescript
// Evaluate existing artifacts:
"Evaluate the quality of this PixiJS artifact and provide improvement suggestions"

// This triggers the evaluateArtifact tool with:
{
  id: "artifact-id",
  criteria: ["performance", "interactivity", "visual"]
}
```

### Optimization

```typescript
// Optimize artifacts:
"Optimize this code artifact for performance and security"

// This triggers the optimizeArtifact tool with:
{
  id: "artifact-id",
  focus: ["performance", "security"],
  aggressiveness: "moderate"
}
```

## Quality Thresholds

| Artifact Type | Quality Threshold | Max Iterations |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| PixiJS        | 7.5/10           | 4              |
| Code          | 8.0/10           | 5              |
| Design        | 7.0/10           | 3              |
| Content       | 7.5/10           | 4              |

## Integration

### Server-Side Integration

The agentic system integrates seamlessly with the existing artifact infrastructure:

```typescript
// artifacts/pixi/server.ts
export const pixiDocumentHandler = createAgenticDocumentHandler('pixi');
```

### Client-Side Features

Enhanced UI components provide access to agentic features:

- `AgenticArtifactToolbar`: Quick access to agentic tools
- `QualityMetricsDisplay`: Visual quality assessment display
- Enhanced artifact actions with agentic capabilities

### Chat Integration

New tools are integrated into the chat system:

```typescript
// app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts
tools: {
  createAgenticDocument: createAgenticDocument({ session, dataStream }),
  evaluateArtifact: evaluateArtifact({ session, dataStream }),
  optimizeArtifact: optimizeArtifact({ session, dataStream }),
}
```

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Higher Quality**: Multi-step generation with quality evaluation
- **Autonomous Improvement**: Automatic refinement and optimization
- **Specialized Expertise**: Domain-specific agents for each artifact type
- **Transparent Process**: Real-time quality metrics and feedback

### For Developers
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend with new agent types
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing artifacts continue to work
- **Scalable Design**: Can handle complex multi-agent workflows

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Advanced Orchestration
- Enhanced orchestrator agents for complex planning
- Multi-agent collaboration for sophisticated artifacts
- Dynamic agent selection based on requirements

### Phase 3: Autonomous Features
- Real-time error detection and correction
- Proactive suggestions based on usage patterns
- Learning from user feedback and preferences

## Technical Details

### Execution Flow

1. **Initialization**: Create execution context with requirements
2. **Generation**: Worker agent creates initial content
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluator agent assesses quality
4. **Iteration**: Improve content if below threshold
5. **Completion**: Finalize when quality standards are met

### Quality Metrics

Each artifact type has specialized quality metrics:

```typescript
// PixiJS Quality Schema
{
  performance: number,      // Rendering efficiency
  interactivity: number,    // User interaction quality
  visual: number,          // Visual appeal
  responsiveness: number,   // Cross-device compatibility
  errorHandling: number    // Robustness
}
```

### Stop Conditions

The system uses multiple stop conditions:

- **Quality Threshold**: Stop when quality score is achieved
- **Max Iterations**: Prevent infinite loops
- **User Satisfaction**: Manual override capability
- **No Improvements**: Stop when no progress is made

This agentic system represents a significant advancement in AI-powered artifact creation, providing users with autonomous, high-quality content generation that continuously improves through specialized AI agents.
